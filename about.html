                <h1>About us</h1>
                <p>VSM College of Engineering established in the year 2009 by Ramachandrapuram Educational society is one of the premier institutions affiliated to JNTU â€“ Kakinada. Keeping in view the vast changes in the requirements of the society and nation at large due to fast delivery in the industrial and service sector, and the recent focus of technical education has been on innovations, research and development along with major changes in the curriculum and strategies of teaching the institution was established inspite of a stiff competition at all levels due to globalization and the output in the form of graduates is required to match with the global expectations. However this institution is trying to cope up with this change and trying its level best to take strategic steps for improvement in this regard. In cognizance of the above, this institution aims to be a leader in technical and management education in the area of East Godavari district and state as a whole and to earn a unique identity for the development of high quality knowledge resource and diversification of teaching engineering and management education.

                <p> OUR EMBLEM  


Every College has an emblem of its own. We too have one.The emblem of the V.S.M. College, Ramachandrapuram was designed with a high purpose and objective. It typifies the principal aspirations of the founders of this new Educational Institution.The motto chosen for the emblem is Vidya Vijayetetaram. It is taken form the Upanishads. It enshrines the truth that Education triumphs over everything else the aristocracy of wealth, social position, power, birth and such other advantages take a secondary place while Education possesses unique value. It is particularly so in the present context of our country development which includes the provision of equal opportunities for education, general and technological, as well to the teeming millions of our countrymen who should take their rightful place at all levels in this our great democracy.

One important condition for the successful working of the democratic institutions is the existence of an intelligent and educated electorate who will be in a position to choose from among themselves suitable persons for manning the political, administrative, and social positions which carry power and responsibility. In our vast sub-continent the growing millions have yet to be provided with adequate opportunities for acquiring higher education. It is hoped that this small institution will contribute its might towards the fulfilment of this objective.

The Taluk of Ramachandrapuram is famous for the temple at Draksharama about three miles from here. The temple Deity is Lord Bhimeswara for whose worship there has been a perennial flow of pilgrims from far and near all round the year. Draksharama is sometimes described as Varanasi of the South. The imposing temple with its characteristic architecture and sculpture is made to appear prominently in the emblem so that it may capture the attention of the students who are expected to be influenced by feeling of awe and sanctity. The emblem is aimed at making every student constantly familiar with the traditional ideas of theism and rich cultural heritage which should enter into the texture of their everyday thoughts.

It is felt that in a secular state like ours, which is of course, not a godless state there is every need for educational institutions inculcating among the youth the basic values of liberal religion which is a potent force for giving a right direction to their social activities. A college is a Temple of Learning wherein the staff and students are humble votaries at the altar of the Goddess of Learning. They are like children gathering pebbles on the shores of the boundless ocean of knowledge. A college is conceived by us as a sacred place where noble thoughts should come from every side so as to chasten the minds and uplift the souls of succeeding batches of young pilgrims who pass through the portals of this temple year after year.It is a matter of common knowledge that Ramachandrapuram area looking always gay and green is a granary of Andhra Pradesh.

The soil is fertile with an unusually large output per unit. Paddy and sugar cane besides many cereals are the main agricultural produce of the area. Agricultural prosperity of course, lies at the foundation fo all economic development. The vegetation indicated in the emblem is an earnest of the quantity as well as the quality of the agricultural output which determines the general standard and pattern of living of the people. Paddy which is grown extensively in this area and also the sugar cane which is a feeder for the local industry are both highly prized commodities from the point of view of self-sufficiency in respect of food and also of being an exchange earner as a semi- commercial crop. The need for higher education in this densely populated and progressive area is the greatest which fact has been kept in view by the sponsors of the college.

The ever auspicious Purnakumbham shown at the base of the temple stands for general prosperity together with traditional ideas of fraternity, self-denial and altruism. In this way the emblem adopted by the college is an attempt at a harmonious blending of the cherished ideals of industry, generosity, pursuit of knowledge and higher values of life based essentially on an abiding faith in an unseen power the deplorable lack of which seems to be at the root of much of the malaise which afflicts the country to day.Appreciative mention must be made that the artist who has designed the emblem is our colleague Mr. M.V. Krishnayya, Lecturer in English.</p>
